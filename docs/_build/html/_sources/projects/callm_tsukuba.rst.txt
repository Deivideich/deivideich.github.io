Project Summary
---------------

Designed and developed an advanced semi-autonomous manipulation pipeline specifically for retail applications.

Technical Architecture
----------------------

**Core Technologies:**
  * **Point Cloud Library (PCL)** - Advanced 3D perception and object segmentation
  * **ROS2 Framework** - Distributed robotics middleware with custom node orchestration  
  * **MoveIt2** - Sophisticated motion planning and collision avoidance
  * **Docker Containers** - Reproducible deployment and environment isolation

**Perception Pipeline:**
  * Point cloud processing and object segmentation
  * Pose estimation and grasp point calculation
  * Octomap plugin for obstacle detection and avoidance

**Manipulation Strategy:**
  * Adaptive grasp planning based on object geometry
  * Trajectory generation  
  * Error recovery and re-planning capabilities
